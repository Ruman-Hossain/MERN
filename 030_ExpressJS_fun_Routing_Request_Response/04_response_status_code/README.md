- [Successful responses (200 – 299)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses)
- [Redirection messages (300 – 399)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages)
- [Client error responses (400 – 499)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses)
- [Server error responses (500 – 599)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses)
